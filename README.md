# WLB Test Assignement

This project is a coding test assignement which consists in implementing for three differents problems three
parameterized python functions. Including a test set of minimum of 2 unit tests per function to verify that the
implementation works as expected. 

## Authors

- [@HamzaRakkabi]


## Running Tests

To run the unit tests, run the following command:

**Function1: contains 4 unit tests as follow**
```bash
  pytest Test_Assignement_WBX.py::test_UT1_function1
  pytest Test_Assignement_WBX.py::test_UT2_function1
  pytest Test_Assignement_WBX.py::test_UT3_function1
  pytest Test_Assignement_WBX.py::test_UT4_function1
```

**Function2: contains 3 unit tests as follow**               
***Note**: Please make sure you have also downloaded the attached directory "main_directory" in the same file directory as the project to run properly the test-set.*
```bash
  pytest Test_Assignement_WBX.py::test_UT1_function2
  pytest Test_Assignement_WBX.py::test_UT2_function2
```

**Function3: contains 5 unit tests as follow**
```bash
  pytest Test_Assignement_WBX.py::test_UT1_function3
  pytest Test_Assignement_WBX.py::test_UT2_function3
  pytest Test_Assignement_WBX.py::test_UT3_function3
  pytest Test_Assignement_WBX.py::test_UT4_function3
  pytest Test_Assignement_WBX.py::test_UT5_function3
```
## Installation

No installation is needed.
    
## Usage
Please refer to the Coding_Test_Assignement_WBX.py file or the check separetly each function in branck: Standalone Function.

## Appendix

Note: Note: many implementations have been tried for the three functions where only the ones with low Time & Space complexity have selected.
